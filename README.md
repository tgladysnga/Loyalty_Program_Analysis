# Loyalty Program Analysis
The dataset contains data on purchases made at the building-material retailer Home World. All of its customers have membership cards. Moreover, they can become members of the store's loyalty program for $20 per month. The program includes discounts, information on special offers, and gifts. 

# Goal
Our goal is to evaluate the result of the introduction of the loyalty program. To achieve this, we need to determine the effectiveness of the loyalty program with regard to average purchases, quantity of items sold, and total revenue.
The target audience is the Project Manager of the loyalty program and the Executive Board of Home World.
The result of our analysis would be needed to help the target audience decide to either develop a strategy to further improve upon the program and boost members' interest and participation or discontinue the program.
